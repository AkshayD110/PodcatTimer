# PodcatTimer
Helps in deciding the speed at which I should run my podcast.

This is smaller than a tiny peice of script, but it is the one which helps me.

UseCase:
I listen to quite a few podcasts, and it is difficult to decide at what speed I should listen them.
Like, from my home to office it takes 30mins to travel, and I want to listen to podcasts within that time.

This tiny script tell me at what speed I should listen to the podcast so that I can finish it within Reaching office.

Upcoming improvements:
1. Add other travel destinations other than office
2. Deciding speed of podcast based on specific channels.
